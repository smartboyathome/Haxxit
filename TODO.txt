I'm using this file as a place to store future tasks.  Feel free to add your own or remove bullets as they're implemented/fixed, but feel no pressure to do so (I plan to keep this updated on my own whenever I get a chance).  -Alex

TO IMPLEMENT:
*Functioning "Saved World" screen for end of game
*Indicators when all spawns have been filled or weight limit reached
*GUI method for players to observe enemy programs/names/abilities
*Ability to save game progress to disk
*Tutorial
*Sound!

TO FIX:
*Can currently select enemy units after the first turn (but cannot issue actions to them)
*Crash when undoing a move over a program's own tail node
*Can currently start level with no programs spawned without losing (AI does nothing)
*Silicoins in maps don't do anything yet
