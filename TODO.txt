I'm using this file as a place to store future tasks.  Feel free to add your own or remove bullets as they're implemented/fixed, but feel no pressure to do so (I plan to keep this updated on my own whenever I get a chance).  -Alex

TO IMPLEMENT:
*Make AI move closer even when there is no path
*Highlight AI attacks
*Functioning "Saved World" screen for end of game
*Implement or remove options selection from main menu (any plans for this?)
*Visual links between each program node
*Indicators when units are placed on spawns
*Indicators when all spawns have been filled or weight limit reached
*Indication when all actions have been used up for the turn
*GUI method for players to observe enemy programs/names/abilities
*Ability to save game progress to disk
*Sound!

TO FIX:
*MemMan sometimes causes crashes when undoing
*Movement selection bug when attempting to attack your own programs
*Ghost movement indicator when actions are undone
*Letter flashes when moving units
*Can currently start level with no programs spawned without losing (AI does nothing)
*Silicoins in maps don't do anything yet
