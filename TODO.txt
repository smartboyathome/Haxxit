I'm using this file as a place to store future tasks.  Feel free to add your own or remove bullets as they're implemented/fixed, but feel no pressure to do so (I plan to keep this updated on my own whenever I get a chance).  -Alex

TO IMPLEMENT:
*Overworld links to new levels
*Functioning "Saved World" screen for end of game
*Implement or remove options selection from main menu (any plans for this?)
*Inclusion of new unit types in store (attempted to add these but ran into trouble with GUI)
*Icons representing each program via head node (tie shop icons to program icons)
*Visual links between each program node
*Unique background texture for all levels
*Ability for player to exit levels before winning/losing (or if stuck)
*Better indicators when units are placed on spawns
*Better indicators when all spawns have been filled or weight limit reached
*Better indication when all actions have been used up for the turn
*Better indication when the turn is ended
*GUI method for players to observe enemy programs/names/abilities
*Ability to save game progress to disk
*Sound!

TO FIX:
*MemMan sometimes causes crashes when undoing
*Movement selection bug when attempting to attack your own programs
*Double highlight bug for ranged attacks
*Ghost movement indicator when actions are undone
*Letter flashes when moving units
*Can currently start level with no programs spawned without losing (AI does nothing)
*initial_silicoins value in maps seems to do nothing (all maps currently reward 500 silicoins)
*Silicoins in maps don't do anything yet
